These are scripts useful for developing

 1. `install` runs `npm install` insider the Docker container. If you don't want to use Docker, you don't need it
 2. `gulp` runs Gulp inside the Docker container. Again, if you're not using Docker, just use your regular `gulp` command
 3. `release` and `deploy-site` are adminstrative tasks you won't need
